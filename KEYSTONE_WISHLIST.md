## ü§ù Integration Notes

**For Keystone Integration:**
- All features should support the existing `@hasDecl()` conditional compilation pattern
- APIs should be designed for high-throughput transaction validation
- Consider mobile/embedded usage patterns for GhostKellz ecosystem
- Maintain backward compatibility during feature rollouts

**Development Approach:**
- Implement features incrementally with feature flags
- Provide comprehensive migration guides for API changes
- Include performance benchmarks for all new features
- Design APIs with future extensibility in mind
